# Makefile Lab - CS 202

## Overview

Welcome to the Makefile lab! This lab focuses on practicing modular C++ programming using header files, function implementation, and proper console input/output. 

This lab is graded on a **"pass / needs work"** basis.  
**No partial credit is given.** You must pass all autograder tests to earn full credit.

## Due Date

Check on WebCampus for due dates. 

If you submit a **reasonable attempt** by the due date, you **may resubmit** your work for a regrade after receiving feedback.

---

## Autograder Tests

The autograder will evaluate your submission using the following tests:

- **Test 1**  
  ✔ Checks for the correct `#include`, `using namespace std;`, and the proper **function prototype** in `myfunctions.h`.

- **Test 2**  
  ✔ Validates that `myfunctions.cpp` includes `myfunctions.h` and uses both `cin >>` and `cout <<`.

- **Test 3**  
  ✔ Ensures there are **exactly two** `cout <<` statements in `main.cpp`.

- **Test 4**  
  ✔ Compiles and runs the program using `make`, assuming the output executable is named **averager**.

## Tips for Passing

- Follow proper file naming conventions: `myfunctions.h`, `myfunctions.cpp`, and `main.cpp`.
- Use `make` to build your program.
- Ensure your main file includes exactly two output statements using `cout`.
- Don't forget to commit and push your changes **before** the deadline.
